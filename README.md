# DELTARUNE: Forecasted

## This is a fanmade take on DELTARUNE: Chapter 6 made originally by the [funnyFeline YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@funnyfeline1), but now, it's being restored! It was made public, and although it was buggy mess, I was able to restore most of it and fill in the blanks.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not take me as the owner of this project. This is owned by the Forecasted team, and even if not canon to DELTARUNE: New Future, is not mine.

Our Current Progress:
- HOMETOWN: ✅100/100 [Completely done.]
- GATEWAY: ✅70/100 [I probably will extend the Gateway one day, the track is too good to hear for a maximum of 2 minutes.]
- DEPTHS: ✅100/100 [May have one or two more rooms added for pacing.]
- BOAT RIDE: ✅95/100 [May need additional bug testing. NOTE: Bug Testing Phase 1 Done.]
- EVERGROVES ❌10/100 [Barely started, requires a lot of work.]
