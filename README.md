# DELTARUNE: Forecasted

## This is a fanmade take on DELTARUNE: Chapter 6 made originally by the [funnyFeline YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@funnyfeline1), but now, it's being restored! It was made public, and although it was buggy mess, I was able to restore most of it and fill in the blanks.

## Custom Features:

### IMPORTANT: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not take me as the owner of this project's entire concept. This concept is owned by the Forecasted team, and even if not canon to DELTARUNE: New Future, is not mine.

## Our Current Progress:
- HOMETOWN: ✅100/100 [Completely done.]
- GATEWAY: ✅99/100 [May require more bug-testing.]
- DEPTHS: ✅95/100 [May have one or two more rooms added for pacing.]
- BOAT RIDE: ✅99/100 [Most likely completely done.]
- EVERGROVES: ❌15/100 [Barely started, requires a lot of work.]
- MANOR: ❌0/100 [Literally the final area of the game, no I have not started it.]
