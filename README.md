# funnyFeline depths

Kristal mod used for "season 1" of [funnyFeline](https://www.youtube.com/@funnyfeline1). Please watch our newer videos. Please. Please. Please.

# Code reuse

The only thing you can't use from this without asking is the Silly Mode popup. You'll need to ask SylviBlossom about that. Everything else is fair game (although I advise against it for your own sanity).

# A word from Fizz regarding this mod:
